# Quiz app

### Bugs to fix: </br>

<ins>**Issue 1**</ins>: If Question type : True / false & start the quiz => the correct answer is always placed in the first option. The options are not shuffled properly.
Even if the user doesn't know any answers, if he / she select the first option, then he can score 100%. </br>
<ins>**Issue 2**</ins>: You can increase your score by clicking the correct answer(i.e showing green) many times until it goes to next question.
<ins>**Issue 3**</ins>: add multiplayer
